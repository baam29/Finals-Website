                        <p>The protagonist, Lee Hansoo, finally reached the boss stage after nine years of playing the game "Dungeon and Stone", which no one had been able to clear until now. However, just as he entered the boss room, he saw a notification alerting him that he had cleared the tutorial and that he had possessed the body of the barbarian, Bjorn Jandel, who was a playable character in the game.</p>
                        <p>In the world of "Dungeon and Stone", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an "evil spirit" and killed.</p>
                        <p>The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life. With the skills he has accumulated over nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game.</p>
